This file is designed to calculate the overall base conversion efficiency in a 1.2 kb long sequence by analyzing a total of 7 fragments individually and merging them into one. Each fragment is around 200 bp long, based on Miniseq analysis, and some of them are overlapping.

This file operates similarly to https://github.com/imhw4157/ABE_detector.

However, in the second line, you need to input the folder path where the NGS files are located, followed by the 7 amplicon sequencing files, separated by tabs in sequential order.
